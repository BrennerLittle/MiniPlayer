# MiniPlayer
A small overlay video player built in electron
This program is written in electron. It is meant to overlay borderless windowed games. It is a very early version and most of the keyboard shortcuts don't quite make sense. Any feedback or contributions would be very helpful. I hope you enjoy the software.
